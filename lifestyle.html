This is, after all, the city that never sleeps. Each of the New York boroughs has its very own unique nightlife scene, so don't be afraid to explore new places.</p>

            <p>The infamous Fifth Avenue is a must, even if only for window shopping, as is trendy Madison Avenue, lined with designer shops including Chanel and Prada.</p>

          <p class="card-text">While roadside vendors selling everything from hot dogs to bagels are a common sight in New York, there are also a number of excellent restaurants for expats to try. All kinds of cuisine can be found in New York, so expats fond of dining out can have whatever their hearts (or stomachs) desire. For the best in restaurant variety head to Queens. Chinatown is good for all types of Asian fare; the East Village has Ukrainian, Indian and Japanese eateries.</p>

          <p class="card-text">With so much going on in terms of shopping, eating out, entertainment and nightlife, many expats can't help but wonder when they will ever get time to keep fit in New York. But the fact is that New Yorkers really are an image-conscious bunch and new arrivals will soon get used to the sight of runners in Central Park, cyclists biking to work and people somehow finding the time to fit in the odd gym session or yoga class.</p>

          </h4>
          <p class="card-text">If you can't walk to your destination, mass transit is the next-best way to get around. The City's rail and bus system is run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and known as MTA New York City Transit. It's inexpensive, environmentally friendly and a great way to see sights throughout the five boroughsâ€”and it operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. To navigate the system, you can now download the MTA's official app MYmta.</p>
